## Design ##
We have received the in terms of 1 row per passengerof 891 records.
We need to aggregate the data on the important features i.e. Age & Sex and Class.
We will need to get the survival rate in % on these groups and then visualize the data in bar charts.


## Feedback ##
### Reviewer 1 ### 
* the age chart is consfuing as the age groups are not ordered.
* fix the spelling and grammatical errors on the page.
 
### Reviewer 2 ### 
* Might be a good idea to label the different bins. Rught now, it's not clear which bin belongs to which class.
* Can the class bins be given different colors?

### Reviewer 3 ### 
Feedback received:
* How about giving an example of another kind of chart, other then bar chart?
