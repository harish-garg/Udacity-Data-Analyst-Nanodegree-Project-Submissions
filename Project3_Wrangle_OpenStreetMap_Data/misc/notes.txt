About the Map Area

Bengaluru, India

https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/bengaluru_india/

The reason I chose is as I am a resident of bengaluru from last 13 years. However, it still keep discoving new areas in this city and thought choosing this area for this project will be a dual learning experience for me - know my current city more as well as finish the project.

Problems encountered in the map

First thing, the full data file is very large. I tried running the code on the full file. and it took really a long time.
So I decided create a smaller sample using the pythin script, provided by Udacity. This gave me a 60 MB file(approx 1//10th of the original)

I ran mapparser.py on the above data file first. The OSM file was parsed successfully and it it showed 421409 Nodes.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
{'bounds': 1,

Next I ran the tags.py script on the OSM file. It showed below data.
{'lower': 163261, 'lower_colon': 7256, 'other': 85, 'problemchars': 3}

There is 3 k tags with problem chars. 

Users.py shows there are 720 unique users who contributed.

72 postal codes (or pIN codes as they are called in India)
the ones with issues are...

     '- 560011',
     '- 560027',
     '- 560034',
     '- 560068',
     '- 560076',
     '380068',
     '530103',
     '5560034',
     '560 068',
     '560 078',
     '560 100'
     
      

Next issue noticed was on running on audit.py. It showed lot of issues in street names. Main issues were badly capitilized names or with special charcters. For example...

"ROad": "Road",
            "road": "Road",
            "stage": "Stage",
            "cross": "Cross",
            "main": "Main",
            "street": "Street",
            "vijayanagar": "Vijayanagar",
            "road\)": "Road",
            "Colony\)": "Colony",
            "Road\)": "Road"
            
Next, I decided to audit the postal codes. All bangalore codes start with 56 and should be of length of 6, comprosing of all numbers.
