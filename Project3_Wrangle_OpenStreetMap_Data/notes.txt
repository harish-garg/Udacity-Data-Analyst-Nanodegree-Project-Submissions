About the Map Area

Bengaluru, India

https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/bengaluru_india/

The reason I chose is as I am a resident of bengaluru from last 13 years. However, it still keep discoving new areas in this city and thought choosing this area for this project will be a dual learning experience for me - know my current city more as well as finish the project.

Problems encountered in the map

First thing, the full data file is very large. I tried running the code on the full file. and it took really a long time.
So I decided create a smaller sample using the pythin script, provided by Udacity. This gave me a 60 MB file(approx 1//10th of the original)

Overview of the Data
size of the file(archived): 38M size of the file(unarchived): 610M number of unique users: number of nodes and ways: number of chosen type of nodes, like cafes, shops etc.
