For this project, I chose Bengaluru, India metro area.

The reason I chose is as I am a resident of bengaluru from last 13 years. However, it still keep discoving new areas in this city and thought choosing this area for this project will be a dual learning experience for me - know my current city more as well as finish the project.

 
The export link from openstreetmap website directed me to https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/bengaluru_india/

Here, I downloaded the bengaluru_india.osm.bz2 file.

The download size of the archived dataset is 38M

The unachived dataset size is 610M
